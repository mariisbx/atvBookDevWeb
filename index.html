                <p>Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good headline
                    for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip
                    that?</p>

                <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We
                    were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
                    headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some

                        collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw
                        some <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.

                        They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to
                        share our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.
